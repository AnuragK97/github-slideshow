Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger; its name was coined as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. The English Wikipedia, with 6.3 million articles as of February 2021, is the largest of the 319 language editions. Combined, Wikipedia's editions comprise more than 55 million articles, and attract more than 17 million edits and more than 1.7 billion unique visitors per month
